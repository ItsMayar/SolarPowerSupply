<h1>Connecting Devices to build solar-based power supply IoT</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
The sun charges the solar panel which sends electricity to the battery for power storage and distribution. A power meter connected between them reads and display the amount of power being captured by the solar panel. Because all devices are connected (IoT capabilities), they register themselves with a registration server, allowing a user to monitor the entire system from a web browser (running in the PC).

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a simple PowerShell script that walks the user through "zeroing out" (wiping) any drives that are connected to the system. The utility allows you to select the target disk and choose the number of passes that are performed. The PowerShell script will configure a diskpart script file based on the user's selections and then launch Diskpart to perform the disk sanitization.
