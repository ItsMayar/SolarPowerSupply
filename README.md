<h1>Connecting Devices to build solar-based power supply IoT</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The sun charges the solar panel which sends electricity to the battery for power storage and distribution. A power meter connected between them reads and display the amount of power being captured by the solar panel. Because all devices are connected (IoT capabilities), they register themselves with a registration server, allowing a user to monitor the entire system from a web browser (running in the PC).
